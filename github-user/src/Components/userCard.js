/*## STEP 2 - Display the User Data

- Pass the data to the component that will be displaying it
- Build out a user card using the data that the Github API returns to you
  - You may reference your old project for this, or you may wish to build this from scratch yourself
  
  ALSO
  
  ## STEP 4 - Style the User Card

- Now it's time to style up your app
- You are free to choose how you style your app, but make it look as presentable as you can
- Try something new here. Maybe that's a new CSS technique you haven't really practiced yet. Maybe it's using a styling library you haven't tried. Push yourself to get better in this area.
